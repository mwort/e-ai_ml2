       "Self-attention is a key component of transformer models, and it's often misunderstood due to its complex mathematical formulation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Notations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* `Q`, `K`, and `V` are matrices representing queries, keys, and values, respectively.\n",
       "* `n` is the sequence length (number of tokens in the input).\n",
       "* `h` is the hidden size (dimensionality of the embeddings).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Self-Attention Layer:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Query-Key Matrix Multiplication**: Compute the dot product between `Q` and `K` to obtain a matrix `A`:\n",
       "\n",
       "$$A = \\frac{Q K^T}{\\sqrt{h}}$$\n",
       "\n",
       "where `^T` denotes the transpose.\n",

       "$$Attention(A) = softmax(A) = \\frac{\\exp(a_i)}{\\sum_j \\exp(a_j)}$$\n",
       "\n",
       "where `a_i` is the `i`-th element of `A`.\n",

       "$$Output = Concat(head_1, ..., head_k) W^O$$\n",
