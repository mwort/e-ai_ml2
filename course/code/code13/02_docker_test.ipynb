    "# Creating and Running a Docker Container from the Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook cell documents how to build and run a **minimal Docker container locally**, using a Python script as payload and writing results back to the host system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Files\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the steps below, the working directory contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "02_code_to_execute_in_docker.py\n",
    "02_dockerfile.txt\n",
    "02_docker_build_output.txt\n",
    "02_docker_run_output.txt\n",
    "02_docker_output.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of each file:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **02_code_to_execute_in_docker.py**\n",
    "  Python code executed *inside* the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **02_dockerfile.txt**\n",
    "  Defines the container runtime (OS + Python + execution command).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **02_docker_build_output.txt**\n",
    "  Captured output of the `docker build` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **02_docker_run_output.txt**\n",
    "  Captured output of the `docker run` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **02_docker_output.txt**\n",
    "  File written by the container and exposed to the host via a volume mount.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1 — Python Code Executed in Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the file `02_code_to_execute_in_docker.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello from Docker\")\n",
    "\n",
    "out = Path(\"02_docker_output.txt\")\n",
    "out.write_text(\"This file was generated inside a Docker container.\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Wrote:\", out)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is **plain Python**, no Docker-specific code.\n",
    "* The output file is written **relative to the working directory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2 — Dockerfile (Runtime Definition)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the Dockerfile as `02_dockerfile.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.11-slim\n",
    "\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "COPY 02_code_to_execute_in_docker.py /app/\n",
    "\n",
    "CMD [\"python\", \"02_code_to_execute_in_docker.py\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Important points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `FROM python:3.11-slim` fixes the Python version and OS layer.\n",
    "* The Docker image already acts as a **virtual environment**.\n",
    "* No `venv` activation is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3 — Build the Docker Image (Shell)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the directory containing the files above, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker build -t python-hello-docker -f 02_dockerfile.txt .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the build output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker build -t python-hello-docker -f 02_dockerfile.txt . \\\n",
    "  | tee 02_docker_build_output.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Docker image named `python-hello-docker` is created.\n",
    "* The build log is stored for documentation and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4 — Run the Container (Shell)\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the container and expose the working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run --rm \\\n",
    "  -v \"$(pwd):/app\" \\\n",
    "  python-hello-docker\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the runtime output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run --rm \\\n",
    "  -v \"$(pwd):/app\" \\\n",
    "  python-hello-docker \\\n",
    "  | tee 02_docker_run_output.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `--rm` removes the container after execution.\n",
    "* `-v \"$(pwd):/app\"` mounts the current directory into the container.\n",
    "* Files written inside `/app` appear on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5 — Verify Host-Side Output\n",
    "\n",
    "After execution, verify that the container produced output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls 02_docker_output.txt\n",
    "cat 02_docker_output.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The container ran successfully.\n",
    "* Data was written **from inside Docker to the host filesystem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Dockerfile freezes the runtime** (OS + Python + libraries).\n",
    "* The **Python code remains unchanged**.\n",
    "* The **Docker image already provides isolation**, similar to a virtual environment.\n",
    "* **Volume mounts control where results appear**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **atomic execution unit** used later in CI/CD and MLOps pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "- a **student exercise variant** with TODO markers.\n",
