    "# Docker and Apptainer: Container Solutions for HPC\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers package applications and their dependencies into portable, reproducible environments. While Docker is the industry standard for containerization, High Performance Computing (HPC) systems require different solutions due to security and infrastructure constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Apptainer for HPC?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docker** requires root privileges and is not permitted on most HPC systems for security reasons. **Apptainer** (formerly Singularity) was designed specifically for HPC environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Runs without root privileges\n",
    "- ✅ Integrates with HPC schedulers (SLURM, PBS/Torque, etc.)\n",
    "- ✅ Compatible with Docker images\n",
    "- ✅ Optimized for parallel filesystems\n",
    "- ✅ Supports MPI and GPU workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container Image Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docker Images:** Multi-layer, mutable format stored in registries like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apptainer Formats:**\n",
    "- **SIF (Singularity Image Format):** Single compressed, read-only file - ideal for distribution and archiving\n",
    "- **Sandbox:** Uncompressed directory - ideal for development and systems with resource constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Container images are built for specific CPU architectures:\n",
    "- **amd64 (x86-64):** Intel/AMD processors - used by most HPC systems\n",
    "- **arm64:** ARM processors - used by Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Important:** You cannot run amd64 containers on arm64 systems and vice versa. Most HPC systems are amd64, so containers must be built for that architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflows Covered in This Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide presents three approaches for creating Apptainer containers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Building on NEC HPC (Sandbox Method):** Create containers directly on the HPC system using the sandbox format to work around memory constraints\n",
    "2. **Building on Mac/Linux (SIF Method):** Create portable SIF files on your local machine and transfer them to HPC\n",
    "3. **Building on GitHub Actions (Automated SIF):** Use GitHub's CI/CD infrastructure to automatically build and distribute SIF files\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the workflow that best fits your needs:\n",
    "- Use **Method 1 (NEC)** if you only have access to the HPC system\n",
    "- Use **Method 2 (Mac/Linux)** if you want to build containers locally\n",
    "- Use **Method 3 (GitHub)** for automated builds, version control, and easy distribution to multiple users"

    "# 1. Running Docker Containers on NEC HPC with Apptainer\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains how to pull and run Docker containers on the RCNL (NEC HPC system) using Apptainer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The RCNL HPC system uses **Apptainer** (formerly Singularity) instead of Docker. Apptainer can pull Docker images and convert them to a format that works on HPC systems without requiring root privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem: Memory Issues During Container Pull\n",
    "\n",
    "When pulling large Docker images, Apptainer compresses them into SIF format using squashfs, which is very memory-intensive and can fail on login nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error you might see:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "FATAL ERROR: Out of memory (frag_thrd)\n",
    "FATAL ERROR: Failed to create thread\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution: Use Batch Jobs with Sandbox Format\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a Job Submission Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file called `pull_image.sh`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "#PBS -q gp_norm_all\n",
    "#PBS -l elapstim_req=01:00:00\n",
    "#PBS -l cpunum_job=4\n",
    "#PBS -l memsz_job=64gb\n",
    "#PBS -N apptainer_pull\n",
    "#PBS -o apptainer_pull.out\n",
    "#PBS -e apptainer_pull.err\n",
    "\n",
    "cd /hpc/uwork/rpotthas/apptainer_test\n",
    "\n",
    "export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=/hpc/uwork/rpotthas/tmp\n",
    "export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/hpc/uwork/rpotthas/cache\n",
    "mkdir -p $APPTAINER_TMPDIR\n",

    "\n",
    "echo \"Build completed at $(date)\"\n",
    "rpotthas@rcnl100:/hpc/uwork/rpotthas/apptainer_test> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key parameters:**\n",
    "- `-q gp_norm_all`: Queue name (supports up to 1920GB RAM)\n",
    "- `-l memsz_job=128gb`: Request 128GB memory\n",
    "- `-l cpunum_job=2`: Use 2 CPUs (fewer threads = less memory)\n",
    "- `--sandbox`: Creates uncompressed directory instead of compressed SIF file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Submit the Job\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "qsub pull_image.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Monitor the Job\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check job status\n",
    "qstat -u rpotthas\n",
    "\n",
    "# View output in real-time\n",
    "tail -f apptainer_pull.out\n",
    "tail -f apptainer_pull.err\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Verify the Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the job completes, you should see a directory:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Other Useful Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Get an interactive shell inside the container\n",
    "apptainer shell docker-plot-03-sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the container's default command\n",
    "apptainer run docker-plot-03-sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute any command in the container\n",
    "apptainer exec docker-plot-03-sandbox <command>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Convenience Wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a script `run-python.sh` for easier use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "apptainer exec /hpc/uwork/rpotthas/apptainer_test/docker-plot-03-sandbox python -B \"$@\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make it executable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "chmod +x run-python.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./run-python.sh my_script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Queue Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Check available queues and their limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "qstat -Qf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On RCNL, `gp_norm_all` queue provides:\n",
    "- **Max Memory:** 1920GB per job\n",
    "- **Max CPUs:** 128 per job\n",
    "- **Default Memory:** 15GB (too low for most container builds)\n",
    "\n",
    "Always explicitly request memory with `-l memsz_job=<size>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: \"Out of memory\" errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Request more memory or use sandbox format\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#PBS -l memsz_job=128gb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: Python bytecode corruption (`EOFError: marshal data too short`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use Python's `-B` flag to bypass bytecode\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "apptainer exec container python -B script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: Container build fails repeatedly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Try these steps in order:\n",
    "1. Increase memory allocation (64GB → 128GB)\n",
    "2. Reduce CPU count (fewer threads = less memory)\n",
    "3. Use `--sandbox` instead of pulling to SIF\n",
    "4. Clear cache: `rm -rf ~/.apptainer/cache`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting Sandbox to SIF (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ IMPORTANT: SIF conversion may not work on RCNL** due to system limits on virtual memory (8GB cap) and process counts. The squashfs compression used to create SIF files requires more resources than the system allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can attempt conversion with this job script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "#PBS -q gp_norm_all\n",
    "#PBS -l elapstim_req=02:00:00\n",
    "#PBS -l cpunum_job=1\n",
    "#PBS -l memsz_job=512gb\n",
    "#PBS -N sandbox_to_sif\n",
    "\n",
    "cd /hpc/uwork/rpotthas/apptainer_test\n",
    "\n",
    "ulimit -v unlimited 2>/dev/null || echo \"Cannot increase virtual memory limit\"\n",
    "ulimit -u 4096 2>/dev/null || echo \"Cannot increase process limit\"\n",
    "\n",
    "apptainer build container.sif docker-plot-03-sandbox/\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"Conversion completed at $(date)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For most HPC use cases, **sandboxes are perfectly fine and often preferred**:\n",
    "- Same runtime performance as SIF\n",
    "- Easier to debug and modify\n",
    "- No compression overhead\n",
    "- Work reliably on systems with strict limits\n",
    "\n",
    "If SIF conversion consistently fails due to system limits, contact your HPC support team or simply continue using the sandbox format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always use batch jobs** for pulling containers (don't run on login nodes)\n",
    "- **Request sufficient memory** (128GB is a safe bet for most images)\n",
    "- **Use sandbox format** to avoid compression memory issues\n",
    "- **Keep the `-B` flag** when running Python to avoid bytecode issues\n",
    "- **Check your quota** with `quota` command before large pulls\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apptainer documentation: https://apptainer.org/docs/\n",
    "- NEC NQSV queue system documentation (check with your system admin)\n",

    "# Building SIF Files on Mac using Lima and Apptainer\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide explains how to build Apptainer SIF files on macOS using Lima (Linux Virtual Machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Lima?\n",
    "\n",
    "Apptainer requires Linux and cannot run natively on macOS. Lima provides a lightweight Linux VM that integrates seamlessly with macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)\n",
    "- Homebrew installed\n",
    "- GitHub account with access to container registries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Install Lima\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install Lima via Homebrew\n",
    "brew install lima\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify installation\n",
    "limactl --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Create and Start a Lima VM\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Start the default Lima instance (Ubuntu)\n",
    "limactl start\n",
    "\n",
    "# This will:\n",
    "# - Download Ubuntu image (~500MB)\n",
    "# - Create a VM with 4GB RAM and 100GB disk\n",
    "# - Set up networking and file sharing\n",
    "# - Take a few minutes on first run\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check VM status\n",
    "limactl list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Enter the Lima VM\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# SSH into the Lima VM\n",
    "lima\n",
    "\n",
    "# You're now in an Ubuntu Linux environment\n",
    "# Your macOS home directory is mounted at /Users/YOUR_USERNAME\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Install Apptainer in Lima\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the Lima VM:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Update package list\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add Apptainer repository\n",
    "sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:apptainer/ppa\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install Apptainer\n",
    "sudo apt install -y apptainer\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify installation\n",
    "apptainer --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected output: `apptainer version 1.4.0` (or newer)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Set Up GitHub Container Registry Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens\n",
    "2. Click **\"Generate new token\"** → **\"Tokens (classic)\"**\n",
    "3. Give it a name: `apptainer-ghcr-access`\n",
    "4. Set expiration (recommended: 90 days)\n",
    "5. Check the **`read:packages`** scope\n",
    "6. Click **\"Generate token\"**\n",
    "7. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure Docker Credentials Permanently in Lima\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lima, set up credentials that persist across sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create Docker config directory\n",
    "mkdir -p ~/.docker\n",
    "\n",
    "# Login to GitHub Container Registry\n",
    "# This saves credentials to ~/.docker/config.json permanently\n",
    "docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME\n",
    "# Password: paste your PAT (not your GitHub password)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verify credentials are saved:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check Docker config exists and has credentials\n",
    "cat ~/.docker/config.json\n",
    "\n",
    "# Should show something like:\n",
    "# {\n",
    "#   \"auths\": {\n",
    "#     \"ghcr.io\": {\n",
    "#       \"auth\": \"base64_encoded_credentials\"\n",
    "#     }\n",
    "#   }\n",
    "# }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your credentials are permanently stored and will be used automatically for future builds!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative: Environment Variables (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer environment variables, add them to your shell profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Edit your bash profile\n",
    "nano ~/.bashrc\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add these lines at the end:\n",
    "export APPTAINER_DOCKER_USERNAME=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME\n",
    "export APPTAINER_DOCKER_PASSWORD=YOUR_GITHUB_PAT\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reload the profile\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The Docker config method is recommended as it's more secure and standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Build SIF Files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Architecture Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Container images are built for specific CPU architectures:\n",
    "- **amd64 (x86-64):** Used by most HPC systems and Intel/AMD servers\n",
    "- **arm64 (ARM):** Used by Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to build different versions depending on where you want to run them:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Architecture | Where to Use | Can Test on Mac? |\n",
    "|--------------|--------------|------------------|\n",
    "| amd64 | HPC/Linux servers (RCNL) | ❌ No (Apple Silicon can't run amd64) |\n",
    "| arm64 | Apple Silicon Mac | ✅ Yes (for local testing only) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build for HPC (amd64 - Required)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the version you'll transfer to RCNL or other HPC systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Navigate to Lima's home directory (writable)\n",
    "cd ~\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build amd64 version for HPC\n",
    "apptainer build docker-plot-03-amd64.sif docker://ghcr.io/eumetnet-e-ai/docker-plot-03:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see a warning: `WARNING: Architecture amd64 does not match build arch arm64v8` - this is expected and harmless.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build for Local Testing (arm64 - Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to test the container on your Mac before transferring to HPC:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Build arm64 version for Apple Silicon\n",
    "apptainer build docker-plot-03-arm64.sif docker://ghcr.io/eumetnet-e-ai/docker-plot-03:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If the Docker image doesn't have an arm64 variant, this will fail. In that case, you can only build amd64 and test on the HPC system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Build Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INFO:    Starting build...\n",
    "INFO:    Fetching OCI image...\n",
    "INFO:    Extracting OCI image...\n",
    "INFO:    Creating SIF file...\n",
    "INFO:    Build complete: docker-plot-03-amd64.sif\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Build Command\n",
    "\n",
    "The command breaks down as:\n",
    "- `apptainer build` - Build a container image\n",
    "- `docker-plot-03-amd64.sif` - Output filename\n",
    "- `docker://` - Pull from a Docker registry\n",
    "- `ghcr.io/eumetnet-e-ai/docker-plot-03:latest` - Image location and tag\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**For most users:**\n",
    "1. Build amd64 version only (for HPC)\n",
    "2. Transfer directly to HPC\n",
    "3. Test on HPC system\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you want local validation:**\n",
    "1. Build arm64 version for Mac testing\n",
    "2. Test your scripts locally\n",
    "3. Build amd64 version for HPC\n",
    "4. Transfer to HPC\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Always remember which version is which - use clear naming like `-amd64` and `-arm64` suffixes!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7: Test the SIF File Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "Before transferring to HPC, test that the SIF works in Lima:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Still in Lima VM, test the container\n",
    "apptainer exec docker-plot-03.sif python --version\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run a simple command\n",
    "apptainer exec docker-plot-03.sif ls /\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get an interactive shell\n",
    "apptainer shell docker-plot-03.sif\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inside the container shell:\n",
    "whoami\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: \"Read-only file system\" when building\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** macOS directories mounted in Lima are read-only\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Always build in Lima's home directory (`~`), not in `/Users/...`\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ~  # Build here\n",
    "apptainer build myimage.sif docker://...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: \"Authentication required\" error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Container registry requires login\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Login with Docker or set environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Method 1: Docker login\n",
    "docker login ghcr.io\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method 2: Environment variables\n",
    "export APPTAINER_DOCKER_USERNAME=your_username\n",
    "export APPTAINER_DOCKER_PASSWORD=your_pat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: \"Transport is not supported\" with registry login\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** `apptainer registry login` doesn't work with all registries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use Docker credentials instead\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Use docker login instead\n",
    "docker login ghcr.io\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: Architecture warning (amd64 vs arm64)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** `Architecture amd64 does not match build arch arm64v8`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:** This is just a warning. The SIF will work on Linux amd64 systems (most HPC clusters)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** You're building on Apple Silicon (ARM) but the target is x86-64 (amd64)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing Lima VM\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Stop the VM\n",
    "limactl stop\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start the VM\n",
    "limactl start\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete the VM\n",

    "scp ~/Desktop/my-container.sif user@hpc:/destination/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keep Lima running:** Start it once and leave it running; it uses minimal resources when idle\n",
    "- **Build in `~`:** Always build SIF files in Lima's home directory, not macOS-mounted paths\n",
    "- **Save your PAT securely:** Store it in a password manager; you'll need it for future logins\n",
    "- **Use specific tags:** Instead of `:latest`, use version tags (`:v1.2.3`) for reproducibility\n",
    "- **Monitor builds:** Large images can take several minutes; watch the progress\n",
    "- **Clean up:** Remove old SIF files from Lima to save disk space: `lima rm ~/old-image.sif`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resource Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "Default Lima VM configuration:\n",
    "- **Memory:** 4GB (adjustable in Lima config)\n",
    "- **CPUs:** 4 cores\n",
    "- **Disk:** 100GB\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase resources, edit Lima's config before first start:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "limactl start --cpus=8 --memory=8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative: Using Docker Desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Docker Desktop installed, you can also use it to run Apptainer in a container, but Lima provides a more native Linux experience for Apptainer workflows.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Building SIF Files with GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide explains how to automatically build Apptainer SIF files using GitHub Actions CI/CD infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use GitHub Actions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Building SIF files with GitHub Actions provides several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Automated builds:** SIF files are automatically created when Docker images are updated\n",
    "- ✅ **No local resources needed:** GitHub provides free Linux runners with sufficient memory\n",
    "- ✅ **Version control:** SIF files are tied to specific image versions\n",
    "- ✅ **Easy distribution:** Team members can download SIF files without building locally\n",
    "- ✅ **Consistent environment:** Builds happen in a clean, reproducible environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- GitHub repository with a Dockerfile or Docker image\n",
    "- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `packages:read` permission\n",
    "- Existing Docker image workflow (or combined workflow)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow consists of these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trigger:** Runs after a Docker image is successfully built\n",
    "2. **Install Apptainer:** Sets up Apptainer on Ubuntu runner\n",
    "3. **Authenticate:** Uses GitHub PAT to access private container registry\n",
    "4. **Build SIF:** Pulls Docker image and converts to SIF format\n",
    "5. **Upload:** Stores SIF file as a downloadable artifact\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens\n",
    "2. Click **\"Generate new token\"** → **\"Tokens (classic)\"**\n",
    "3. Give it a name: `GHCR_READ_PAT`\n",
    "4. Set expiration (recommended: 90 days or longer for automation)\n",
    "5. Check the **`read:packages`** scope\n",
    "6. Click **\"Generate token\"**\n",
    "7. **Copy the token immediately**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Add Token to Repository Secrets\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to your repository on GitHub\n",
    "2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**\n",
    "3. Click **\"New repository secret\"**\n",
    "4. Name: `GHCR_READ_PAT`\n",
    "5. Value: Paste your PAT\n",
    "6. Click **\"Add secret\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Create the Workflow File\n",
    "\n",
    "Create `.github/workflows/build-sif.yml` in your repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",

    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: \"Authentication required\" error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** PAT is missing or incorrect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** \n",
    "1. Verify `GHCR_READ_PAT` secret exists in repository settings\n",
    "2. Check PAT has `read:packages` scope\n",
    "3. Ensure PAT hasn't expired\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: Workflow doesn't trigger\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Workflow name mismatch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Ensure the workflow name in `workflows: [\"...\"]` exactly matches your Docker workflow name (found in the Docker workflow's `name:` field)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: \"Out of memory\" during SIF build\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Large Docker images may exceed runner memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use GitHub's larger runners (requires paid plan) or simplify your Docker image\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: SIF file is too large\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Docker image contains unnecessary files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Optimize your Dockerfile with multi-stage builds and `.dockerignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use specific tags:** Instead of `:latest`, use version tags (`:v1.0.0`) for reproducibility\n",
    "2. **Retention policy:** Set artifact retention to 90 days to save storage\n",
    "3. **Cache dependencies:** Cache Apptainer installation to speed up builds\n",
    "4. **Test locally first:** Ensure Docker image works before setting up automation\n",
    "5. **Document versions:** Keep track of which SIF corresponds to which code version\n",
    "\n",
    "## Artifact Retention\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, GitHub keeps artifacts for 90 days. You can customize this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "- name: Upload SIF artifact\n",
    "  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4\n",
    "  with:\n",
    "    name: docker-plot-03-sif\n",
    "    path: docker-plot-03.sif\n",
    "    retention-days: 30  # Keep for 30 days instead of 90\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced: Publish SIF to Release\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of artifacts, attach SIF files to GitHub releases:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "- name: Create Release and Upload SIF\n",
    "  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1\n",
    "  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')\n",
    "  with:\n",
    "    files: docker-plot-03.sif\n",
    "  env:\n",
    "    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires tagging your commits:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git tag v1.0.0\n",
    "git push origin v1.0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison of Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Pros | Cons |\n",
    "|--------|------|------|\n",
    "| **GitHub Actions** | Automated, no local resources, easy distribution | Requires setup, 90-day artifact limit |\n",
    "| **Local (Mac/Linux)** | Full control, test locally, no automation needed | Requires local setup, manual process |\n",
    "| **HPC Sandbox** | No SIF needed, works with system limits | Not portable, directory format only |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Actions provides a scalable, automated solution for building SIF files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up PAT with `read:packages` permission\n",
    "2. Add PAT as repository secret\n",
    "3. Create workflow file with Apptainer installation and build steps\n",
    "4. Download artifacts from GitHub Actions runs\n",
    "5. Transfer to HPC system\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is ideal for teams, continuous integration, and distributing containers to multiple users without requiring them to build locall"
