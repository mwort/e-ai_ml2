# E-AI — AI/ML Intensive Training Course (ECMWF, January 2026)

This repository contains the material for the **E-AI AI/ML Intensive Training Course**, developed in a first version in 2025 at DWD and given to 160 participants, revised and extended and delivered at **ECMWF in January 2026** for 220+ participants from **ecmwf staff**.

The course provides a structured, hands-on introduction to **modern AI/ML methods** with a strong focus on **weather and climate applications**, including operational perspectives, reproducibility, and best practices for building reliable ML workflows.

---

## Scope and Learning Goals

After completing the course, participants will be able to:

- work confidently with **Python** and **Jupyter notebooks** for AI/ML workflows
- understand core ML concepts: models, loss functions, optimization, generalization
- implement and train neural networks in **PyTorch**
- understand **LLMs** and modern workflows such as **RAG**, **tool/function calling**, and **agents**
- apply AI/ML methods to typical meteorological data formats (GRIB, NetCDF, OpenData)
- connect AI/ML workflows to operational themes: verification, monitoring, reproducibility, MLOps/CI
- gain an overview of AI weather models (e.g. **Anemoi, AIFS, AICON**) and AI-based data assimilation

## Course Structure (5 Days)

The training is organized as **5 days**, with **20 sessions** (Chapters 1–20). Each session is complemented by a lab session, where codes are run and discussed in small groups.

## Repository Contents

Typical contents include:

- **Slides** (LaTeX sources and PDFs) for lectures (lec01–lec20)
- **Jupyter notebooks** with demos, exercises, and reference workflows
- **Figures and graphics** used in the course
- supporting **scripts** for data access and processing
- `requirements.txt` / environment definitions

Large datasets are generally **not stored in Git**. See `data/` notes if present.
